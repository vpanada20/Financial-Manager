                terms right! But have youw ever wondered where does this all fit in our daily lives? Money is something we cannot live
                without. We need money for almost all aspects of our lives. Sometimes is becomes difficult to manage our hard earned
                money. We hope that we can share some insight on how to utilise money.</p1>
